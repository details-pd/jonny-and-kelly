/* =========================================================
   KIT CONFIG — everything recipient-specific lives HERE.
   Re-skinning this experience for a new person / life event
   (e.g. a baby shower) should mean: swap the assets referenced
   below and edit these values. No changes to main.js.

   Coordinate conventions:
   - board fractions: 0..1 of board width/height (x right, y down)
   - slot angle: degrees, CSS clockwise
   - track: waypoints in board fractions; main.js smooths them
     into a path (Catmull-Rom), pawns travel along it

   NOTE ON Y VALUES: the board art is Kharisel's artboard with 110
   render-px of cream inserted under the top frame, so the couple can stand
   on the top red piece without their heads running off the board
   (tools/build-board-v4.py). Every y below is therefore the artboard value
   mapped through y' = (y * 6516 + 110) / 6626. Re-run that tool if the
   artboard changes; it prints these numbers. The pad was 360 until Sarah
   asked for the gap above the board tiles to be closed (Aug 20) — 110 is
   the minimum that still clears Kelly's hair, helped by starting the couple
   lower on the red piece.
